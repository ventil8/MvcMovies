Intro to ASP.NET MVC 4 as seen on http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/mvc-4/getting-started-with-aspnet-mvc4/intro-to-aspnet-mvc-4

This tutorial will teach you the basics of building an ASP.NET MVC 4 Web application using Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2012 or Visual Web Developer 2010 Express Service Pack 1. Visual Studio 2012 is recommended, you won't need to install anything to complete the tutorial. If you are using Visual Studio 2010 you must install the components below. You can install all of them by clicking the following links:

Visual Studio Web Developer Express SP1 prerequisites WPI installer for ASP.NET MVC 4 LocalDB SSDT If you're using Visual Studio 2010 instead of Visual Web Developer 2010, install the WPI installer for ASP.NET MVC 4 and the: Visual Studio 2010 prerequisites

A Visual Web Developer project with C# source code is available to accompany this topic. Download the C# version.

In the tutorial you run the application in Visual Studio. You can also make the application available over the Internet by deploying it to a hosting provider. Microsoft offers free web hosting for up to 10 web sites in a free Windows Azure trial account. For information about how to deploy a Visual Studio web project to a Windows Azure Web Site, see Create and deploy an ASP.NET web site and SQL Database with Visual Studio. That tutorial also shows how to use Entity Framework Code First Migrations to deploy your SQL Server database to Windows Azure SQL Database (formerly SQL Azure).
